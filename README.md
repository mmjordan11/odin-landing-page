## Reflection
1. This project was completed mostly as a review of HTML & CSS after taking
approximately 9 months off from coding.
2. I was able to fly through the lessons on The Odin Project and complete this
project quickly. (~.5 week)
3. The review will be a good launching pad for future projects so that I do not
get stuck looking up a lot of trivial HTML, CSS, and Git concepts/commands.
4. I felt that, given a clear design layout, I was able to easily create a
professional looking webpage. I think I should use "standard layouts" and
simple color schemes like this on my own personal projects.
5. Keep remembering to commit often and write strong commit messages!
